- I don't have a machine with RISC-V architecture, so I had a lot of problem setting up qemu for running the programs I was going to write for RISC-V. There were lot of weird things I had to do to make it work.
- So, I thought if I'm going to do that anyway, why not go all the way. Why not write directly to RISC-V hardware (emulated hardware) without OS there to help me.
- Since my goal is to learn OS dev, this works out perfectly.
- So I'm gonna be writing various kinds of kernels to learn RISC-V.
