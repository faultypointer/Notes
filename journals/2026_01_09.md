- Back on logseq. This time things are a little different.
- I still haven't figured out the workflow, but I have gained some info from past note taking experiences that - hopefully - will prove helpful.
- The first thing that's different is, although I've named this graph "Notes", It will not contain any notes of sort. At least not for the most stuff. The notes for projects and other stuff will remain in their respective directories. The only thing this graph will contain is their existence and maybe their progress.
- That's the whole point of this graph. To keep track of the stuff I'm doing (and have done as well as will do), journaling, and also links to resources. [Speaking of which]([[Resources]])
- Now, how do I do this for keeping tracks of stuff and such?
- Writing everything in this journal seems tempting.
- NOW [[Atomics and Locks]]
